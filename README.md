# GelSightOperation
Repository containing wrapper functions for operation of a GelSight camera.  Does not require ros for operation. In addition to RGB frames from the Gelsight camera, the repository contains the processing code to generate a process image of depth, strain_x, strain_y. (This can be nicely visualized using the LAB color space)
